## Method #2: The I-want-to-see-the-code way.

Note: To avoid any unwanted hassles, you can easily run the code on Google Colab.

### 1. Let's install the necessary packages
Inorder to do this, please run the commands on screen.

``` python
pip install fuzzysearch
pip install fuzzywuzzy
pip install textdistance
```
**OR**

If you're using anaconda, please follow:

``` python
conda install -c conda-forge fuzzysearch
conda install -c conda-forge fuzzywuzzy
conda install -c conda-forge textdistance
```
**OR**

If you want to copy my exact anaconda environment, run: 
(This is not really necessary)
(Also, do this after downloading the repository)
``` python
conda env create -f src/environment. yml
```


Note: Only the _fuzzysearch_ library is actually required to perform the fuzzy search operation. Rest of the libraries have been used only for further testing.

### 2. Now let's run the code

Download the code using this command and set current location as the directory.
``` 
!git clone https://github.com/abhishek-choudharys/FUS-E.git
cd FUS-E
```

If you want to see the results on pre-defined input file by entering the keyword, just run test_keyword.py.
You can enter your search query here, based on largeText.txt.
``` 
run src/test_keyword.py
```

If you want to test it on your input file, run test_customFile.py.
Enter the address of the text file when prompted, and then enter your query.
``` 
run src/test_customFile.py
```
